🏡 Predicting Housing Prices with Machine Learning
📌 Overview
This project involves building a machine learning model to predict housing prices based on various features. The dataset used is the Ames Housing dataset, which contains 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa.

🎯 Objectives
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data.

Preprocess the data, handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

Build and evaluate multiple regression models.

Select the best model based on performance metrics.

Deploy the model using a simple web application.

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualized distributions of key features.

Identified correlations between features and the target variable.

Detected and handled outliers.

🛠️ Data Preprocessing
Imputed missing values using appropriate strategies.

Converted categorical variables using one-hot encoding.

Scaled numerical features using standardization.

🤖 Modeling
Trained multiple regression models: Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, and XGBoost.

Performed hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.

Evaluated models using RMSE and R² metrics.

🏆 Results
The XGBoost model achieved the best performance with an RMSE of 0.12 and R² of 0.92 on the test set.

🚀 Deployment
Developed a Flask web application to input new data and predict housing prices.

The app allows users to enter feature values and displays the predicted price.
