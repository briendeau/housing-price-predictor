## üß† Overview

This project aims to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes in Boston suburbs using various features such as crime rate, average number of rooms, and accessibility to highways. We employ multiple regression techniques and evaluate their performance.

## üìä Dataset

The [Boston Housing Dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html#boston-house-prices-dataset) contains information collected by the U.S Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston Mass. It has 506 instances with 13 features.

**Features:**

- CRIM: per capita crime rate by town
- ZN: proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
- INDUS: proportion of non-retail business acres per town
- CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
- NOX: nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
- RM: average number of rooms per dwelling
- AGE: proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
- DIS: weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
- RAD: index of accessibility to radial highways
- TAX: full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
- PTRATIO: pupil-teacher ratio by town
- B: 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town
- LSTAT: % lower status of the population

**Target:**

- MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's
